**WebStudio** is a website with a presentation of services, team, and project
portfolio. It is the first educational project created for practical
consolidation of layout basics and web page structure building.

Developed following mobile-first principles, which ensures correct content
display on any device. The project includes a main page with a hero section,
features section, team, and work examples, as well as interactive elements: a
service order modal window and a mobile navigation menu. The layout is built
with pure HTML and CSS using Flexbox and BEM methodology.
